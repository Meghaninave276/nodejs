Not everything has to be perfect to be moving forward.”\n\n“Some days I feel ahead, some days I feel lost, but I’m still showing up and that counts for something. Progress isn’t always obvious, but it’s happening.”\n\n“Figuring life out in real time, making mistakes, adjusting, and trying again. It’s not glamorous, but it’s honest.”\n\n“I don’t have everything planned and I’m okay with that. I’m trusting that consistency and patience will carry me where I need to be.”"
